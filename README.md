# qMGR
    qMGR is an algorithm used to study the rearrangement of mitochondrial genomes. Using it, we can calculate rearrangement frequency of a single gene or rearrangement score of a single genome in a certain population. 
    The “qMGR.php” is the main program of this algorithm written in php and perl;
    “benchmark.txt” is one of the input files that primarily describes a comparable reference sequence for the genome arrangement, where each gene is separated by a comma. It is used for qMGR.php or qMGR.pl;
    The “input_example.txt” is is another input file that is primarily a genetically ordered file of multiple genomes to be tested by the user. It is only used in qMGR.php;
    The “input_example_for_perl.txt” is an input file similar to "input_example.txt”. But it is only used in qMGR.pl.
