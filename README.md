# qMGR
    qMGR is an algorithm used to study the rearrangement of mitochondrial genomes. Using it, we can calculate rearrangement frequency of a single gene or rearrangement score of a single genome in a certain population. 
    “qMGR.php” is the main program of this algorithm written in php language;
    “benchmark.txt” is one of the input files that primarily describes a comparable reference sequence for the genome arrangement, where each gene is separated by a comma;
    “input_example.txt” is another input file that is primarily a genetically ordered file of multiple genomes to be tested by the user.
